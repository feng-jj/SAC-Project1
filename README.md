## Introduction
This WebApp is a data dashboard for the Sexual Assault Center in Nashville, TN containing three elements: 
* An authentication system to gain access to the dashboard
* A data entry portal
* Data visualization dashboards
Upon logging in, SAC employees can input their team's operational data which is visualized in a team-specific dashboard through various graphs and charts. Visualizations display data month-to-month. Additionally, employees can retroactively modify their team's inputted data, but not the data of other teams. A registered admnistrative "super-user" can modify any team's data.
